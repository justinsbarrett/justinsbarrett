# Howdy!

I'm Justin Barrett. I've been messing with code in various forms since I was 11-ish. My dad bought us a Commodore VIC-20,
and while I mostly typed in programs from magazines (yes, that was a thing!), I wrote a few of my own, including a simple
assembly language program that animated a static Pac-Man-like character.

While I took a couple programming classes in junior-high and high school, I'm mostly self-taught. Here's a rough chronology
of my programming language experience:

* BASIC and assembly (Commodore)
* Pascal (Apple II?)
* VBA (Excel, early 2000s)
* PHP
* JavaScript (cursory dabbling)
* MEL (Maya Embedded Language)
* Python
* JavaScript (more serious)

Currently I'm the IT Manager for [Lights Over Atlanta](http://lightsoveratlanta.com).
On the side I'm an [Airtable consultant, developer, and teacher](http://allaboutthatbase.tips).
