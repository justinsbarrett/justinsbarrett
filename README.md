# Howdy!

I'm Justin Barrett. I've been messing with code in various forms since I was 11-ish. My dad bought us a Commodore VIC-20,
and while I mostly typed in programs from magazines (yes, that was a thing!), I wrote a few of my own, including a simple
assembly language program that made a little Pac-Man-like character open and close his mouth.

While I took a couple programming classes in junior-high and high school, I'm mostly self-taught. Here's a rough chronology
of my programming language experience:

* BASIC and assembly (Commodore)
* Pascal (Apple II?)
* Visual Basic for Applications (Excel, early 2000s)
* PHP
* JavaScript (cursory dabbling)
* MEL (Maya Embedded Language)
* Python
* JavaScript (more serious)

Currently I'm an [Airtable consultant, developer, and teacher](http://allaboutthatbase.tips), which is how I got back into the world of JavaScript.
I write scripts for use in Airtable's internal scripting environments (the Scripting app and automation script actions)
and create custom Airtable apps using React. At the time I'm writing this (Feb 2022) I'm planning to start
messing with React Native to create mobile apps.
